                                                          How to us




First of all the code is described by comments or the code is given certain classes with part name + 
what the code is doing iit will help you understand it 

Second there is gap after every part of a page code for your understanding so u dont have to be confused

Third the css is also commented or given gap or named part is used before starting any part for your understanding


If you still are having problems to understand what part is doing what things read below if you want to or go 
see pros or cons in the last:

When you open the code you would see display.html page which is the main page this page is commented full + its css
when you will open any page of the site or its css you see there is a gap the gap indicates next part of page with the 
word part I mean section of page and even befoe starting a page I have written the part name which is like.part_2 in
which indicated part 2 of page



Note:
 you might see part_2 2 ties in display.html page the first part_2 is part 2 n=but the second is part_4 I didnt changed 
it becz i thought its not a big deal if you dont want it you can remove it remember part 4 is written as part_2 but the 
real part 2 is written as part_02 the zero(0) makes difference for understanding of yours
